This is the website for people attending Alex's wedding

1. Convert code to HTML5 + CSS3.

2. Create a mobile version of the website for easier viewing on phones.

3. Remake Contact Us Form so it is visible in IE

4. Remake Slider so it is visible in IE.

5. Website is currently unviewable in IE as it does not see the 
<!--#include virtual="/tavanowedding/header.shtml"--> and the <!--#include virtual="/tavanowedding/footer.shtml"-->
as well as the CSS on the pages.

6. Text on the Accommodations page does not match up. I tried to move the sandman hotel picture up about 10 pixels 
so its even, but i cannot find where i changed that as all of them changed.

7. Touch yourself, you deserve a break.

8. Wow not too much, calm down now theres work to be done.

9. Once the contact form is working, make sure the CSS color slider, and the 
pictures for Name, Email, and message appear. As well as make sure that the text is purple inside the box much like in Chrome and FireFox.
